How to get rid of my migraine. _Take this with a pinch of salt!_

### Backgrodund  

In the last two decades or so I had migraine. It had a quite regular schedule kicking in the weekends. Sometimes on Friday, while still at work, most often on Saturdays or Sundays, usually lasting for half to two days. Somtimes just mild, sometimes very bad. With time they became more regular and more often, lately almost every weekend. Medication (paracetamol or ibuprofen) gave some relief, especially if taken early at the first symptomps, but with time it did not helped too much.

### Observations

(These are not properly logged observations or experiments, more like "as I remember")

- I do not sleep enough during the week, usually 6 hours, sometimes less, go bed late, get up early. In the weekends I try to make up for the lack of sleep, stay in bed longer and/or nap in the afternoon. Even less sleep makes the symptom worse.
- During summer vacation I sleep more, but headaches still come, with one expection (I will come back to this later). 
- Flu or other illness make the regular headaches worse, or rarely induce "off-schedule" ones.
- I almost never consume alchohol, and never had real hangover, but I have just read a short popular review [article](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23231040-800-hung-over-what-science-says-about-why-you-feel-so-rough/) in New Scientist about it, and several symptoms are overlapping with my migraine, and the feelings (aura) preceeding the headaches, namely:
  - drowsiness, sleepiness, headache, nausea, weakness, reduced alertness, concentration problems, increased reaction time, reduced appetite, agitation, memory problems, audio sensitivity, photosensitivity.
- For some time I did not regulary drink coffee, now I drink 2 cups a day. Sometimes I feel that coffee helps, or missing the regular coffee make migraine worse, but this is not very consistent.
- My fault, I never seeked professional medical advice. My conclusion, based on the random popular and professional articles I have read, was that this is something not well enough understood by science, yet and there is no proper cure.

### My "theories" 

As a scientist (working on quite distant fields) I cannot restrain myself to make "theories" (not taking them seriously even by myself). I will not list them all here, but my basic observation based on the quasi-periodic behaviour, is that this should be some kind of resonance ([in physic's sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance)), like in some (bactarial? viral? chemical?) systems. There are nice examples for [population dynamics models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations) or [coupled oscillating chemical reactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belousov%E2%80%93Zhabotinsky_reaction). 

In an ideal experiment I would take daily blood samples for a couple of weeks, measure as much chemicals, hormones as possible or even better, make gene expression analysis on each samples. (Side note: despite the fiasco of [Theranos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos), I beleive, that this is not that far fetched.) 

### My experiment and "best theory"

One observation leading to my "current best theory" was our last summer vacation in Sicily. Though it spanned through jut two weekends I had no headaches. Maybe because of the good (Mediterrean and/or volcanic) air, the relaxation, or maybe because of the lot of pizza. 

Then, recently I have read a paper about a large statistical correlation analysis of headaches and food consumption. The paper is titled ["Severe Headache or Migraine History Is Inversely Correlated With Dietary Sodium Intake: NHANES 1999â€“2004"] (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/head.12792/full) and as the title says people consuming more salt have less headache. See also a [popular article here](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23130873-400-does-eating-more-salt-prevent-migraines-and-severe-headaches/) expressing the puzzlment over the results: _"We might have expected the relationship to go in the other direction. "_. Oh, those delicious pizzas! I thought immidiately, and started to pour salt on everything. Actually, before I was very short on consuming salt, since this is the global health advice, and also since my father had serious cardiovasular problems, and I tried to prevent them.

Shortly after I read another paper which brought the enlightment. I a recent paper titled [Headache Disorders May Be a Risk Factor for the Development of New Onset Hypothyroidism](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/head.12943/abstract;jsessionid=EC098B545362B57F8281B1C7103E4F12.f01t03) researchers find association between migraines and low level of thyroid hormones. Though they investigate the other way, headache disorders are a risk factor for the development of new onset hypothyroidism, this is still a correlation.

From this my conjecture comes trivially. As we know, regular diet does not always contain enough iodine that is needed for the production of thyroid hormone. In several countries, including Hungary where I live, iodine is added to salt. Fearing heart attack -> I do not consume salt -> I do not get enough iodine -> I have low level of thyroid hormones -> that induce headaches.

Further confirmation came when I have checked the symptomps of hypothyroidism. Images of people with this problem showed puffiness around the eyes. My father has these characteristic circles around his eyes and as I age I noticed them on myself, too. Also thyroid hormones have characteristic peridoic changes, see for example this paper: [Free Triiodothyronine Has a Distinct Circadian Rhythm That Is Delayed but Parallels Thyrotropin Levels](http://press.endocrine.org/doi/10.1210/jc.2007-2674). This is inline with my theory, that the underlying cause is some kind of resonance. [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=tsh+migraine) now (early 2017) lists 14 papers for keywords _TSH migraine_, which is not much, better keywords may pop up more. Among the papers there is one titled [Low headache prevalence amongst women with high TSH values](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11784355) and also a new, that I have just noticed: [New Daily Persistent Headache Caused by a Multinodular Goiter and Headaches Associated With Thyroid Disease](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/head.13011/abstract).

These were enough to me, to take this more seriously than my previous theories. The next professional sstep would have been to have measured my thyroid hormone levels in my blood and find some doctor who is willing to investigate this. This is still a plan, but I thought that adding some iodine to the list of my daily vitamins would not pose significant health risk. So I got "[bioactive iodine](http://www.kekjod.hu/)" supplement (funny blue liquid) from the local pharmacy (requires no prescription) and started self-medication with 3 drops each evening. (TODO: calculate the _mg_-s of iodine, this contains.). 

As a miracle now __my migraine is gone__. In the last three months I take iodine there was only one occasion (when I had also some flus symptoms, too), when I felt that headache may come, and took some Advil, and got through without migraine. 

### Caveats : DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME! THIS IS NOT A MEDICAL ADVICE! I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL DOCTOR! CONSUMING VARIOUS CHEMICALS MAY KILL YOU!

This may of course be just some placebo effect and this may not last long. Even if for my case this is a solution, most probably there are many types of headaches and for some, extra iodine may make things worse.
