Recent studies have shown that the pathomechanisms of migraine involves both factors responsible for immune response and oxidative stress such as: cytokines, tyrosine metabolism, homocysteine; and factors associated with pain transmission and emotions e.g.: serotonin, hypocretin-1, calcitonin gene-related peptide, glutamate. ..." <br/> [__Note:__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_hormones) "The thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and its prohormone, thyroxine (T4), are tyrosine-based hormones "

Association analyses between migraine and probe expression levels, adjusted for age and gender, revealed an excess of small p values, but there was no significant single-probe association after correction for multiple testing. Network analysis of pooled expression data identified 10 modules of co-expressed genes. One module harboured a significant number of differentially expressed genes and was strongly enriched with immune-inflammatory pathways, including multiple pathways expressed in microglial cells. ..."
- Natural remedy? https://draxe.com/hypothyroidism-diet-natural-treatment/ Ashwagandha is an adaptogen herb that helps the body respond to stress, keeping hormone levels better in balance. Adaptogens helps lower cortisol and balance T4 levels. In fact, in clinical trials, supplementing with Ashwagandha for eight weeks helped hypothyroidism patients significantly increase thyroxine hormone levels, which reduced the severity of the disorder. (2) Also, try other adaptogen herbs like rhodiola, licorice root, ginseng and holy basil that have similar benefits.

The drug works by targeting and blocking a pain-signalling molecule in the brain called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)._

    - _" We infer strong positive selection, in agreement with ancient DNA showing high frequency of the allele in Europe 3,000 to 8,000 years ago. rs10166942 is important phenotypically because its ancestral allele is protective of migraine."_
